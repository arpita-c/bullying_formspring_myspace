Not technically true The studio wanted a straight American remake but Rodriguez didn t want to so he progressed the story on slightly

Haha I will answer Because if some chick screws her boss to get a raise how much respect is there in that She s basically a whore That s an extreme example but generally the meaning is the same I don t respect girls who use their looks to get what they want in the work place

soooo how the hell does that put other women at a disadvantage LOL don t even answer

Personally I think everything is based on personal merit I ve come up against several men of power in my life who are inherently sexist but I have never failed to get what I wanted because I never let them regard me in a lower way I think if you have enough respect for yourself and a general air of confidence you can get most things done This is probably because I grew up training horses with guys though You can whine bitch and moan I think women are definitely at a disadvantage because there is a high percentage who rely on being cute to get their way which can work to an extent but not in a way which will earn you any kind of respect in the future More likely a pat on the head and a send her on her way

That s what I m saying There s no respect in that relationship So how can they be equal

Key Phrase She s basically a whore

finally a sharp minded teen

This thread just made my morning

Seriously And like anyone else in the forum sounded like a moron I hate condescension

Women have made great strides here in the past few decades thanks in part to the feminist movement Women have more opportunities available to them now than they ve ever had At least in recorded history They are now able compete in more sports than ever before and they now have equal access to colleges and schools and to most careers And now with equal access women are showing that they can hang and even outshine the boys More women than men are going to college and more are graduating and starting new careers On some campuses almost 70 of the student population is female Women are taking on more leadership responsibilites and some tests show that women in general make better managers or leaders Women in their twenties in most large cities in the US are actually making more money than the men in their own age group A lot of successful women are finding it hard to find a man who makes what they make More and more women are actually making more than their husband of boyfriend I do believe society has become more feminized Just look at the news with the war in Iraq Ever since Vietnam people have begun to question war and the need for it Women historically have never been in favor of war and most men are becomming that way I believe Women are definately making a huge mark on history at this very moment and I do believe we will see more of a female influence on leadership politics education etc etc etc where before they never had a voice

That depends on an individual s idea of common It was mainly isolated to cults of the ancient mystery religions i e specifically Greece Egypt which had their roots from the mother son worship started by Semiramis aka Astarte Isis etc upon the death of Cush father of Nimrod aka Osiris Bacchus etc

Heath was ok I thought Jack Nicholson was a really good Joker though

I don t know what the big deal was about the Dark Knight batman s voice was stupid and over done and heath ledger did a horrible job Im glad he died Nothing beats Jack Nickolson s performance of the Joker

I never saw it I love skater movies too hmm why did I not see this

I never saw it I love skater movies too hmm why did I not see this

One of his lesser known movies He was good in it His career was barely taking off though and to be bad he passed away at such a young age

You re better off just watching Dogtown and Z Boys

Heath s Joker was the closest to Joker in the comics I suggest you read The Killing Joker and you ll understand Heath is how the Joker was originally written Jack s Joker was how DC changed him back in the 50 s and 60 s where they made him more a practical joker then a homicidal mad man But to each their own

I saw some interview with Nicholson when Ledger died he said he had warned him about the character or something like that I think if you get that run down by a character you are a kook to begin with and maybe should lay off the narcotics

I d say fully emerging yourself into a character that has serious mental issues is a lot more traumatizing than playing a character that has a homosexual relationship

You come off as a jerk because you said that you re glad Heath s dead because you didn t like his performance in The Dark Knight It s ok if you didn t like the movie or Heath s performance but to say that you re glad he s dead is what makes someone say you have a low IQ

In career terms that s the tragic thing about his death that he seemed to be coming into his own as a great actor

haha Welcome to the movie forum If you say you didn t like TDK All the trolls and fanboys come out of the woodwork to defends Heaths half ass potrayal of the Joker Get used to it apparently it s all they got

Ok Johnnie You and the dumbass that you re defending need to go back and read the previous posts that said dumbass contributed to this thread Those posts are what makes him a dumbass not the fact that he doen t like TDK

I agree with Rodney

http www time com time nation article 0 8599 399921 00 html Entire commentary

So what you are really saying is that poor people favor democrats But if that was the case why aren t the majority of poor white amaericans also democrat Statistically more white people rely on social services than blacks

Please explian why Reagan would choose to deliver his first campaign speech in Mississippi at the urging of Trent Lott no less a known bigot and racist This is exactly the kind of denial that the article talks about

Nah you said republicans as a blanket statement Black politicians take more advantage of their own race than anyone else Jesse Jackson Al Sharpton

Thankyou Where are all these Reagan Conservatives I keep hearing about I really hope their silence on this topic is because they are all deep in contemplation wrestling with their own inner demons I ll assume that

reagan was a demagogue I see that now But he did effectively enrapture the nation in patriotism to a fault most didn t see the fractured thinking of reaganomics until the 90 s when it was too late the reason that you re not hearing from reagan conservatives is because most have morph d either into the army of compassionate conservatives or as myself have morph d into independent voters who look a little more analytically at politics now

So you re a racist too then Got ya I wouldn t have said that no matter how close a friend he was to me The fact is he s a racist so is Lott and Lott even went on a crying jag apologizing left and right for his remarks Even he thinks it was wrong

I didn t say all republicans are racist what I said rather was that the republican party has a history of racism Also the republican party is in denial about this and this is exactly why most blacks will not vote for a republican If you read the article the author suggests that it is a good thing that Bush is reaching out to black voters finally but it will not work until the republican party adresses it s racism in the past I ve yet to hear a good reason for Reagan to deliver his initial campaign speech repleat with overtones of states rights vs federal rights in Philadelphia MI the exact town in which three civil rights workers were murdered in one of the 1960s ugliest cases of racist violence It was a ringing declaration of his support for states rights a code word for resistance to black advances clearly understood by white Southern voters If this wasn t race baiting what was it Please explain

I would have told him the same thing at his 100th birthday party

The Democrat party has a history of being the party of slavery

No blacks were not given access to credit and property in the manner that whites were due to racism In the 60 s many black neighborhoods were destroyed to make the interstate highway system the replacement was high density public housing In 68 when king died blacks destroyed their own commercial centers but these were OWNED by whites and rented to blacks That was part of the anger to this day most of these places are still just as they were after the riots In combination with the drugs that were imported into the cities by Regean to destroy the black pride movement these things destroyed confidence and morale in the black community causing them to blame the man Most of the children from the 70 s grew up to be either cynical adults or backstabbers to the ppl they left behind when they made it like Barrack and Michelle Obama

This was addressed Ken Mellman did apologized for the use of the Southern Stragety but many hardcore conservatives like Hannity and Limbaugh said that its a waste of time

You re delusional

Thankyou Where are all these Reagan Conservatives I keep hearing about I really hope their silence on this topic is because they are all deep in contemplation wrestling with their own inner demons I ll assume that

reagan was a demagogue I see that now But he did effectively enrapture the nation in patriotism to a fault most didn t see the fractured thinking of reaganomics until the 90 s when it was too late the reason that you re not hearing from reagan conservatives is because most have morph d either into the army of compassionate conservatives or as myself have morph d into independent voters who look a little more analytically at politics now

So you re a racist too then Got ya I wouldn t have said that no matter how close a friend he was to me The fact is he s a racist so is Lott and Lott even went on a crying jag apologizing left and right for his remarks Even he thinks it was wrong

I would have told him the same thing at his 100th birthday party

come on Speeds a good movie

I wouldn t say that Since 2000 he has worked on almost 140 projects That s almost 18 projects a year

I wouldn t say that Since 2000 he has worked on almost 140 projects That s almost 18 projects a year

I wouldn t say that Since 2000 he has worked on almost 140 projects That s almost 18 projects a year

I was only exaggerating

i had no problem with transformers i actually LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie i thought it was a well done movie and the funny thing is i had never heard of transformers until i saw the previews and the movie looks amazing so i saw it ther first day and it was amazing shia leboufe is hot im sure i spelled his last name wrong but still what a hottie

Check out this awesome thread

I don t think his death had anything to do with it The performances of the cast and the execution of the film stands on its own

it s your opinion and you re entitled to it

you re not alone i have a co worker that feels the same way more or less

If you really didn t like it then I can respect that but you will have to do better than Bale s voice as Batman Itwas an established fact comic book that Batman spoke with a gravelly typevoice If you expected it to be cheesy then why did you go to the theater to see it I personally only go to the theater to see movies thatI think are going to be good all the rest I can wait for DVD The fact that you started a thread while there is one pinned just to state your disgust with the film makes you an attention whore GOOD JOB

I think alot of critics feel obligated to give it good ratings because of Ledgers death

TDK was better than Begins I didn t like begins But I liked TDK Because of the acting but I still don t like the Bale over voice acting as Batman

My cycle is broken

It s called welfare Earl

Bale s Batman voice was shit and that concludes the list of things not awesome about The Dark Knight The movie is badass Best non indie of the Year mainstream NEVER tops indie And now Corrections to dumb comments made earlier by people who just didn t know any better 1 The Dark Knight is a gift from god Specifically to me 2 Ledger s Joker is in fact the greatest portrayl of a super villain of all times Primarily due to the fact that He played it in such a realistic way If a super villain like The Joker did really exist I imagine that he d be exactly like that Most super villains in movies don t have the level of realistic character depth that Ledger along with the amazing writers brought to the joker Besides I dare the OP to suggest who IS the greatest villain then since the joker isn t 3 I agree that other films have been storywise on par and better than The Dark Knight But what makes this one stand out is that it was done on a mainstream scale This movie is VERY noir and dark unhappy movies are generally not so big with the mass public Thats why we ve rarely seen it done if ever in a guaranteed blockbuster hit like a Batman movie or any other big name superhero movie I think with the success of The Dark Knight big budget studios may stop playing it safe and start producing more films that think outside hollywood box Dark Knight was awesome Very Awesome

There s a couple of idiots in this thread I think it s obvious who they are

Of course his death had something to do with how big it got Hello the same thing happened with The Crow it got soo big because of Brandon Lee s death and was praised to be like gods work I mean yeah its good but its not a present from god the same situation here

I really don t get these psycho fanboys attacking everyone who didn t like the damn movie It s a f ing Batman movie grow up All your bitching and moaning won t change the fact that the movie was just OK and nonething more No one deserves an oscar and no new ground was broke The f ing Batmobile was stopped by a stupid rocket launcher WTF ha ha ha It was a kids movie written to appeal to the emo generation I guess that explains all the boo hoos and I ll kill myself if Heath don t get an oscar Some of you REALLY need to get outside more

Jesus Christ

This was a present from God

Batman was thinking outside of the hollywood box hahahahahahahahahaha and apparently professors should start using this movie as a prime example for character study and development Because obviously Heath Ledger is the greatest actor of all time Get real

I mjust an overzealous forum slut

My cycle is broken

It s called welfare Earl

all your bitching and moaning about batman is the same

Bale s Batman voice was shit and that concludes the list of things not awesome about The Dark Knight The movie is badass Best non indie of the Year mainstream NEVER tops indie And now Corrections to dumb comments made earlier by people who just didn t know any better 1 The Dark Knight is a gift from god Specifically to me 2 Ledger s Joker is in fact the greatest portrayl of a super villain of all times Primarily due to the fact that He played it in such a realistic way If a super villain like The Joker did really exist I imagine that he d be exactly like that Most super villains in movies don t have the level of realistic character depth that Ledger along with the amazing writers brought to the joker Besides I dare the OP to suggest who IS the greatest villain then since the joker isn t 3 I agree that other films have been storywise on par and better than The Dark Knight But what makes this one stand out is that it was done on a mainstream scale This movie is VERY noir and dark unhappy movies are generally not so big with the mass public Thats why we ve rarely seen it done if ever in a guaranteed blockbuster hit like a Batman movie or any other big name superhero movie I think with the success of The Dark Knight big budget studios may stop playing it safe and start producing more films that think outside hollywood box Dark Knight was awesome Very Awesome

There s a couple of idiots in this thread I think it s obvious who they are

Of course his death had something to do with how big it got Hello the same thing happened with The Crow it got soo big because of Brandon Lee s death and was praised to be like gods work I mean yeah its good but its not a present from god the same situation here

I really don t get these psycho fanboys attacking everyone who didn t like the damn movie It s a f ing Batman movie grow up All your bitching and moaning won t change the fact that the movie was just OK and nonething more No one deserves an oscar and no new ground was broke The f ing Batmobile was stopped by a stupid rocket launcher WTF ha ha ha It was a kids movie written to appeal to the emo generation I guess that explains all the boo hoos and I ll kill myself if Heath don t get an oscar Some of you REALLY need to get outside more

This was a present from God

Jesus Christ

Batman was thinking outside of the hollywood box hahahahahahahahahaha and apparently professors should start using this movie as a prime example for character study and development Because obviously Heath Ledger is the greatest actor of all time Get real

Yeah we should have kept ignoring him it would drive him crazy in a couple of days

Originally I had doubts as to weather or not this film was going to live up to the hype But after seeing it this week I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised It was arguably one of the best action flicks I had seen in quite some time

Isn t the US unemployment rate a false statistic As far as i know It only shows the people claiming benefits not the total people who are out of work Im no economist Indonesia but the middle class growth your talking about surely if the pattern continues that most jobs are outsourced to other nations then wouldn t the middle class will begin to stifle That 80 dollar nike shoe thats sold in China is also sold in the US People need well paid jobs to have disposable income The more disposable income the more sales of branded products are possible If industrial jobs keep going abroad for cheaper labour then the less cash people have at home to keep the whole thing ticking over How are people supposed to buy 80 shoes when jobs keep going abroad

Don you re idiodic piece of shit I don t need a source Anyone who reads one of your posts can tell If there is a God he s turned his back on this country so many times it s a wonder he haven t nuked heaven

I was reading your post and though for a moment on your use of the words ignorant and misinformation as you repeatedly wrote mccaint I thought for a moment that it was ironic that it was you who were guilty of using misinformation with his name then I realized nah you re just ignorant

Arron here your source Take a trip to Iran See how long it takes them to cut out your head and air to the world to see It sounds like you have no doubts that Iran is your friend

ditto what don said

I can t help it that God always gives the US the upper hand We seem to be protected by him I know that it hurts you becasue you have so much faith and you have been forsaken by your god The problem is you have a false god created by a false prophet

Its you again DId you delete my last forum

Last minute research and listening to pundits does not quite equal the same as actually following the campaigns And a lot of people have died for a lot of rights we don t invoke at every opportunity Also it really did sneak up on me

Because my candidate dropped out And I don t think that either mainstream candidate has the best interests of the country and it s citizens in their real plan I also think the founding fathers would want another revoloution by now

Ok thats a good reason not to vote But it s not a smart thing to do People have fought and died to allow you this right you should be proud to do your own research and vote for the person you believe in

I don t have the power to delete forums I can only show you how you are an idiot

Hey cut down on your meat intake Blood pressure not good

Aren t their issues on all the radio and tv stations You don t have to do much research

Simple I didn t follow the campaigns at all and so have no idea what the candidates stand for or what their views are Also Lazy

Support free speech and add to the conversation

Some people don t watch TV or listen to the radio not because they are lazy but because the political system in this country is flawed Dems try to make it about hope and future even though they can t really bring about a better future and the Republican try and win by using fear a vote for Obama is a vote for a terrorist as the videos you have posted proves so thanks for proving my point for me Desperate Republicans

Ehud We may have elected Bush twice but at least we didn t elect Gore whom I voted for and am glad that he lost or Kerry who wanted Carter and Baker to be in charge of middle east policy And Olmert has what a 3 approval rating and you can t get rid of him He is the architect of the disaster in Lebanon the failure to take adequate steps against the Kassams and a whole lot of bribery At least Bush s ratings are higher than congresses Both the Republcians and Democrats suck at energy policy Since the first oil embargo in 1973 America has done NOTHING about alternate i e nuclear energy I think they have been bribed by the Saudis who paid for clinton s and Carter s libraries and hired James Baker III as a lobbyist

Well you didn t vote for Olmert that s big fact 1 Conversely something like 49 99999999999999999 of Americans didn t vote for Bush over Kerry Conversely 50 0000112145246345645746734637 of Americans didn t vote for Bush over Gore So the ones who didn t vote for Bush are kind of in the same boat as you with regards to unpopular leaders

I agree it would be nuts to equate Bush with either All three were in control and were all brutal dictators Bush is just a poor sap who s letting himself be lead along by the likes of Cheney and Rummy and their business interests It would also be interesting to see how Bush Snr s company has done since the launch of this war on terror

LMAO Are you joking First off Olmert s got a bad approval rating but doesn t quit what am I supposed to do about it assassinate him grow up you turd I voted for someone else the Elders party won t vote for them again and that s it now as for the US voting Dubyah in TWICE First off both Gore and Kerry would have been better for the US and for the world Hell even YOU would have made a better president well maybe not YOU but let s say Shawn In 20 years Dubyah s gonna be recited in one breath with Hitler and Stalin and Mao you dumbass He s the worst thing that happened to the US since Vietnam As if electing him once wasn t bad enough you actually were STUPID enough to repeat the same mistake TWICE in a ROW

It does and as much as I dislike Bush I can t give him credit for everything he does I really do believe the real power is with the likes of Cheney and Rumsfeld who were both major players in the Bush snr and Reagan admins If another Republican gets in and those two are still in the administration we won t see a change in presidency just a different spokesman

Yes I ve seen it I have a short review on my page don t know if this is permitted to say so delete ignore whatever if so I highly recommend reading something about the movie before seeing it if you plan to Otherwise most people will be befuddled as the apparent plot isn t extremely clear and lost in translation a bit too I m fascinated with the Inca Aztec and Mayan cultures so was looking forward to seeing this Don t know that this is a spectacular movie but I think the depiction of the culture is pretty accurate JMO

What Christian doesn t Let s give the guy a break He was Mad Max

dude this movie was awsome i thought the only thing was i have no idea what the beheadings were all about can anyone tell me i didnt know that was going on also was the virus and disease going around from when the europeans came to town that wasnt columbus at the end was it the lady havin the baby in the water was a little extreme but man it was an awsome movie

I LOVED IT sooo good and people need to lay off on the guy must see it was 2 1 2 hrs long but it didn t seem like it

I just hope it s sufficiently better than Passion of the Christ Anyway people do need to lay off Gibson He was drunk and he apologized

What Christian doesn t Let s give the guy a break He was Mad Max

i suspect that it s an accurate portrayal of the bloodlust that existed in the real lives of those ancient people The Aztecs were few in number compared to neighboring tribes so war games that ended in human sacrifice meant fewer enemies And fear is also a great weapon to keep a population under control I think it was more political than bloodlust With all the violence in our movies the average American probably sees more blood spilled in violence alibet fake than anyone else on the planet now or in the past Bill

Call me crazy but isn t this movie about the Mayans I haven t seen it yet but if the movie is ultraviolent then it s historically accurate The mayans were a blood thristy violent race of people I ve visited mayan ruins and learned about the history behind them They were savages pure and simple and if the film wasn t ultraviolent it would be doing a disservice to the reality behind their culture

Mel has some serious blood lust issues i suspect that it s an accurate portrayal of the bloodlust that existed in the real lives of those ancient people

I can see him being drunk when he made The Passion of the Christ but I didn t know he apologized for it

I dunno I heard it was real good But I m not really a fan of mel s films I might check it out though

it was good Violent as hell Mel has some serious blood lust issues

hey Im not complaining I like watching a good spear thru the head as much as the next guy Mel s blood lust is my viewing pleasure And as much as professor Claven s yapping about historical accuracy is true I think its pretty damn obvious looking at his films the man likes displaying his ultraviolence There is complete justification for the horrific realism in Passion of the Christ too It definitley worked for the effect he was going for But he was having way too much fun with beating down ol JC

Yes I ve seen it I have a short review on my page don t know if this is permitted to say so delete ignore whatever if so I highly recommend reading something about the movie before seeing it if you plan to Otherwise most people will be befuddled as the apparent plot isn t extremely clear and lost in translation a bit too I m fascinated with the Inca Aztec and Mayan cultures so was looking forward to seeing this Don t know that this is a spectacular movie but I think the depiction of the culture is pretty accurate JMO

i recall the timeline for central america was something like this toltecs mayans and aztecs maybe the news had it wrong or mel anyway it was a good movie oh and i know the whole timeline thing is off but i was just thinking of the last three major civilizations in central america so correct me if i m wrong and no the Inca don t apply CENTRAL AMERICA NOT SOUTH AMERICA

dude this movie was awsome i thought the only thing was i have no idea what the beheadings were all about can anyone tell me i didnt know that was going on also was the virus and disease going around from when the europeans came to town that wasnt columbus at the end was it the lady havin the baby in the water was a little extreme but man it was an awsome movie

Bringing back mass transit would be ideal Filling up the average Semi costs 600 00 why not put that money back on the rails It would take a long time to update the country decades most likely but the end result could would be fantastic

clintion maybe but Bush talk to Iran please They didnt talk to saddam when they invaded all they did was send to UN to make it like the US didnt want to go to war

Below are a few lines from Obama s books his words From Dreams of My Father I ceased to advertise my mother s race at the age of 12 or 13 when I began to suspect that by doing so I was ingratiating myself to whites From Dreams of My Father I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother s race From Dreams of My Father There was something about him that made me wary a little too sure of himself maybe And white From Dreams of My Father It remained necessary to prove which side you were on to show your loyalty to the black masses to strike out and name names From Dreams of My Father I never emulate white men and brown men whose fates didn t speak to my own It was into my father s image the black man son of Africa that I d packed all the attri butes I sought in myself the attributes of Martin and Malcolm Dubois and Mandela From Audacity of Hope I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction

Bush didn t talk to them They re the Axis of Evil remember And we don t negotiate with terrorists remember And you can t possibly think that those quotes would win Obama votes You can t really do much in this country without the white vote and it s not like especially when taken out of context those quotes really help him in any way

Despite O Bama s pathetic book Soon to be turned into an epic movie staring Wesley Snipes on condition that he wins his appeal and Angelina Jolie if it s between him and McLame I ll have to go for the big O The European Union is just as if not more concerned about nukes in Iran Let them take the lead here Overlooked in all of this is just who the hell is supplying Iran with the technology The point being why is the US barking at the dog instead of going after it s master Russia Even IF Iran develops nukes Big IF they don t have much of a delivery system and certainly nothing in the range that would put the US in Harms Way Again a European problem Speaking of Harms Way the State of Israel would be Iran s intended target Bush as well as his predecessors have all been lap dogs to the Jewish lobby and it s interests I don t see any of the Presidential candidates changing that unfortunate trend either Alls more the pity

This isn t even debatable anymore The ARMED FORCES JOURNAL the bunch of pansy pacifist liberals that they are argued that waterboarding torture some time ago http www armedforcesjournal com 2007 12 3230108 TO RUDY GIULIANI AND ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE MICHAEL MUKASEY For their tacit support of waterboarding In an interview Giuliani was asked for his views on using enhanced interrogation techniques including waterboarding He responded that in a hypothetical scenario that assumed an attack I would tell the people who had to do the interrogation to use every method they can think of Prompted again on the specific use of waterboarding he repeated every method they could think of Mukasey said he found waterboarding to be repugnant but he wouldnt answer whether it amounted to torture Let AFJ be crystal clear on a subject where these men are opaque Waterboarding is a torture technique that has its history rooted in the Spanish Inquisition In 1947 the U S prosecuted a Japanese military officer for carrying out a form of waterboarding on a U S civilian during World War II Waterboarding inflicts on its victims the terror of imminent death And as with all torture techniques it is therefore an inherently flawed method for gaining reliable information In short it doesnt work That blunt truth means all U S leaders present and future should be clear on the issue
